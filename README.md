# multisearch
Desktop OS X appâ€” Run multiple Internet searches in a single window 

This application simultaneously launches a search across multiple Internet sites and lets you browse through the results within a convenient OS X interface.  I built this application to help me do quick lookups on Chinese words that I didn't know, so it is currently programmed to search a few sites that are probably not be relevant to you:

* Google.com.tw basic image search
* Wiktionary.org

If I get any requests I will add an interface to customize what sites to search.  As it stands you can fork the source code and change them yourself.

Currently supports OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  If you need support for an older version, let me know.
